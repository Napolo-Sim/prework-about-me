      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi everyone, my name is Napoleon Vuong and I am a student at Foothill College studying Computer and Data Science! I currently work as a Tutor at my local highschool and hope to become an experienced we developer by the end of this Coding Bootcamp!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Redwood city and have lived in California all my life. My childhood was spent within the foggy streets of San Francisco until I moved to the sunny central of the Silicon Valley just outside Palo Alto.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy spending a lot of my time indoors playing board games, watching movies, and overall having a good time with the people around me.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to become a Video Game Designer and help develop immersive experiences filled with action, adrenaline, and high tempo fun. My favorite video game since I was a little kid was definitely Call of Duty. I wasn't meant to play that game at that age, but thats honestly what made it fun.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Atherton, a small city  surrounded by the tech filled giants within the Silicon Valley such as Google, Facebook, Tesla, apple, and Microsoft. Its a busy city, with a lot of geniuses around. Can't wait to join the loop.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I believe expanding my knowledge and understanding web development will help me to become more competitive in the markets I am trying to find myself in. I am only a student in college so I know that competing for jobs is that much harder and I want to prove that I can have the skills that hirers are looking for.</p>
